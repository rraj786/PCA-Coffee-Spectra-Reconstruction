# PCA Coffee Spectra Reconstruction
This project applies dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reconstruct reflectance spectra of two types of coffee beans (**Arabica** and **Robusta**). This allows us to differentiate between the beans using a minimal amount of information.
